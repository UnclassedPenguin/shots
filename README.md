## Shots Tracker

Hmm..


//ID 
//Date &timeStr
//Gun (-g string) &gun
//Ammo Type (-at string) &ammoType
//Ammo Weight (-aw int) &ammoWeight
//Number of Shots (-n int)
//Ammo Price (-ap float64) &ammoIndivPrice
//Total Price (float64) &ammoTotalPrice
//Notes

//d.AddRecord(db, timeStr, gun, ammoType, ammoWeight, number, ammoIndivPrice, AmmoTotalPrice, notes)

### To-do
- Create a docs page on docs.unclassed.ca/shots
- Possibly Remove Notes. They break the formatting if they are too long...
  - maybe I dont need to remove it. But maybe I need to not show it when you list...unless you specifically specify to list notes...
- ~~Add a projectile weight category~~
- ~~Add a projectile type category~~
- ~~Add a projectile cost category~~
- ~~Add a total cost for each row~~
